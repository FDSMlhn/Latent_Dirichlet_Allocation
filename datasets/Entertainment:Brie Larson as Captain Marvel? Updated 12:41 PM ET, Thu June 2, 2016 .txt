 (CNN)We already knew a "Captain Marvel" movie was coming, but now we may have a face to go along with the name.
Variety has reported that Brie Larson could be the star of what is an eagerly awaited Marvel standalone film.
Marvel has not commented on the report.
Captain Marvel has been an extremely popular character throughout the years, and the role would make the Oscar-winning actress of "Room" the first woman to lead a Marvel film if she is indeed cast.
According to Entertainment Weekly, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed in 2014 that the film was coming and would feature a female Captain Marvel as the character in the comic books has had different iterations.
"Let me clarify," Feige said then. "Captain Marvel has gone by many names in the comics, has had many people who've inhabited that costume and used that power base. I want to make it very clear: This hero's name is Carol Danvers." 
Just the mere thought of Larson potentially as the beloved superhero was enough to get social media going.
